# script2layout
## a simple tool translating text output from scrivener to basic comic panel layouts

TODO:
* Auto-calculate non-defined panel sizes, even when mixed with defined panel sizes on same page
* If no shot is chosen use alternating talking heads
  * Let panel know its predecessor (even across pages)
* Create a page showing an error for pages with wrong panel sizes (e.g. third followed by full strip)
* Improve syntax check of script file
* Add Tests and comments
